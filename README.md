# Visitor Management System (VMS)

A desktop-based Visitor Management System developed, designed to modernize and streamline visitor interactions within the company. Built using **C#**, **SQL Server**, **Crystal Reports**, and other industry-standard tools, the system enhances security, efficiency, and data visibility.

## Project Overview

Embarking on my first major project, this system allowed me to turn theoretical knowledge into a functional and practical software solution. It automates visitor check-ins and check-outs, integrates with the employee database, and sends notifications via email and SMS — ensuring both smooth operations and secure visitor handling.
